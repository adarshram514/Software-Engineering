# Training for HTML & Research for Flask Application

## Objective
The purpose of this research is to gain a better understanding of how the Hindsight project will utilize Flask and to learn how to implement it into front-end development.

## Expected Learning Outcome
I will learn how to utilize Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and the Flask HTML files to create and modify a sufficient user interface (UI) for the application. Specifically, I aim to grasp the basics of HTML.

## Expected Implementation Outcome
By the end of the training, I expect to have a better understanding of HTML and a general idea of how to create and modify HTML files to design and customize a user dashboard for the Hindsight project application based on Flask HTML applications.
